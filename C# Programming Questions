4. Count the occurrences of each character in a string without using LINQ.
5. Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
6. Write a method to compress a string — e.g., `"aaabbbcc"` → `"a3b3c2"`.
7. Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
8. Given a sentence, reverse only the words — e.g., `"Hello World"` → `"World Hello"`.
9. Remove all duplicate characters from a string while maintaining order.
10. Find all permutations of a given string.

38. Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array.

---

## 🔹 Section 6 — Trees & Graphs (Q39–Q44)

39. Implement Binary Search Tree (BST) with `Insert`, `Search`, and `Delete` operations.
40. Perform In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversal of a Binary Tree iteratively.
