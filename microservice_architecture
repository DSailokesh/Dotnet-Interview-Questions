This is a great request! Since this is about creating a learning planner (not a code search task), I don't need to search any repository. Let me create a comprehensive, structured **Microservices Learning Planner** — from basics to advanced — with scenario-based and concept-based questions, tailored for your 8 years of full-stack experience.

|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | What are Microservices? Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices | Basics |
| 2 | Principles: Single Responsibility, Loose Coupling, High Cohesion | Basics |
| 3 | Service boundaries & Domain-Driven Design (DDD) basics | Basics |
| 4 | Communication styles: Sync vs Async | Basics |
| 5 | REST API design for microservices | Basics |

### ❓ Concept-Based Questions

1. What is the **Single Responsibility Principle** in the context of microservices? How does it differ from OOP's SRP?
2. What are the **key differences** between Microservices, SOA, and Monolithic architecture?
3. What is **Loose Coupling** and **High Cohesion** in microservices design?
4. How do you decide **service boundaries** when decomposing a monolith?
5. What is **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and how does it help define microservice boundaries?

7. What is the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** communication?

### 🔥 Scenario-Based Questions

1. **Scenario:** You are working on an e-commerce monolith with modules for Orders, Inventory, Users, and Payments. How would you decompose it into microservices? What would be your first step?
2. **Scenario:** Two teams want to own the concept of "Customer" differently — one for billing, one for shipping. How do you handle this in DDD?
3. **Scenario:** A junior developer says "Let's create one microservice per database table." What are the problems with this approach?
4. **Scenario:** Your service boundaries are unclear and two services are tightly coupled, sharing the same database. How do you fix this?

## 📅 PHASE 2 — Service Communication (Week 3–4)

### 🧠 Core Concepts

| # | Topic | Depth |

| 4 | API Gateway pattern | Intermediate |
| 5 | Service Discovery (Client-side vs Server-side) | Intermediate |
| 6 | Load Balancing | Intermediate |

### ❓ Concept-Based Questions

1. When would you choose **gRPC** over REST in microservices communication?
2. What is an **API Gateway**? What responsibilities should it have vs NOT have?
3. What is **Service Discovery**? Explain Client-side vs Server-side discovery with examples.
4. What is the **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** pattern?
5. What is **Circuit Breaker** pattern and why is it critical in sync communication?
6. What is **bulkhead pattern** and how does it prevent cascading failures?
7. What is **retry with exponential backoff** and when should you use it?
8. What is the difference between **orchestration** and **choreography** in microservices?

### 🔥 Scenario-Based Questions

1. **Scenario:** Service A calls Service B synchronously. Service B is slow and causing Service A to time out, which then causes Service C (calling Service A) to fail. How do you fix this cascade?
2. **Scenario:** You need real-time communication between services for a financial transaction. Would you use REST, gRPC, or a message queue? Justify.
3. **Scenario:** Your API Gateway is becoming a bottleneck — every request, even between internal services, passes through it. How would you redesign this?
4. **Scenario:** You need to expose different data shapes for a mobile app and a web app from the same microservices. What pattern do you apply?
5. **Scenario:** Service discovery is failing intermittently. Instances are healthy but not being found. What could cause this and how do you debug it?

8. When would you use **CQRS + Event Sourcing** together?

### 🔥 Scenario-Based Questions

1. **Scenario:** You have an Order service and an Inventory service. When an order is placed, inventory must be reserved. If inventory reservation fails, the order must be cancelled. How do you implement this without distributed transactions?
2. **Scenario:** A customer complains that their profile update is visible in the mobile app but not on the website. What is likely happening and what is the expected behavior in an eventually consistent system?
3. **Scenario:** Your read queries on the Order service are slow because you have millions of orders. How would you use CQRS to fix this?
4. **Scenario:** You need to reconstruct the full history of state changes for an account. Would you use Event Sourcing? What are the trade-offs?
5. **Scenario:** A saga fails midway through a 5-step process. How do you ensure data consistency across 3 services that already completed their steps?

5. What is the difference between **Authentication** and **Authorization** in the context of a microservices API Gateway?
6. What is **token introspection** vs **local JWT validation**? Trade-offs?

2. **Scenario:** A developer hard-coded a database connection string in the Docker image. How do you remediate this in production and prevent it going forward?
3. **Scenario:** Your API is being flooded with requests from a single IP during a sale event. The API Gateway is not blocking it. What do you configure?

2. **Scenario:** CPU spikes on your Order service every night at 2 AM. No errors in logs. How do you investigate?
3. **Scenario:** You need to ensure your payment service has 99.9% uptime SLO. How do you set up alerting and what metrics do you track?

## 💡 Tips for Your Study Approach

Given your **8 years of experience**, I recommend:

- ⚡ **Skip Phase 1 basics** if you already know them — do a self-test with the scenario questions first
- 🔁 **Phases 3 & 4** are most important for senior-level interviews and production systems
- 🧪 **Build a mini project** — an e-commerce system with Order, Inventory, Payment, and Notification services — to apply every concept hands-on
- 📌 **Phases 5 & 6** are often underestimated — security and observability questions are very common in system design rounds
- 🏗️ Since you use **RabbitMQ + MassTransit**, Phase 3's Saga + Outbox pattern will feel very natural for you
