- Blob types: Block Blob, Append Blob, Page Blob
- Access tiers: Hot, Cool, Archive
- Storage account types: LRS, GRS, ZRS, GZRS
- Public vs Private access levels
- SAS Tokens vs Access Keys vs Managed Identity

### Concept-Based Questions
1. What are the differences between Block, Append, and Page Blobs? When would you choose each?
2. You need to store log files that are written sequentially and rarely read. Which blob type and access tier would you choose and why?
3. What is the difference between LRS and GRS replication? In which scenario would you prefer GRS over LRS?

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Intermediate

### Concepts
- Lifecycle Management Policies (auto-tier/delete blobs)

- Static Website Hosting from Blob Storage
- CDN integration with Blob Storage
- Shared Access Signature (SAS): User Delegation SAS vs Service SAS vs Account SAS
- Private Endpoints for Blob Storage

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Scenario:** Your application stores user profile images. After 30 days of no access, they should move to Cool tier; after 180 days, they should be deleted. How do you implement this?
2. **Scenario:** A compliance requirement states that financial records stored in Blob must not be modified or deleted for 7 years. What feature do you use and how do you configure it?
3. **Scenario:** You need to give a third-party vendor temporary read access to a specific container for 2 hours without sharing your account keys. How do you handle this securely?

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Advanced

### Concepts
- Blob Storage Events with Event Grid
- Change Feed for Blob Storage
- Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) with Azure Key Vault
- Network rules: VNet Service Endpoints vs Private Endpoints

- Multipart upload patterns for large files
- Optimistic concurrency with ETags and Lease Blobs

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Scenario:** Your microservice needs to trigger a downstream event (via RabbitMQ/MassTransit) whenever a new file is uploaded to Blob. How do you architect this using Azure Blob + Event Grid + Azure Functions?
2. **Scenario:** Your storage account keys were accidentally exposed. What immediate steps do you take, and how do you prevent key exposure in the future using Managed Identity?
3. **Scenario:** You have a .NET microservice that uploads 2GB files to Blob Storage. Uploads are timing out. How do you solve this using chunked/multipart upload with the Azure SDK?
4. **Scenario:** Two microservices try to update the same blob simultaneously. How do you handle concurrency conflicts using ETag/lease mechanisms in .NET?

- Custom handlers for non-supported languages
- Azure Functions + Event Grid vs Service Bus: choosing the right trigger
- Blue/Green deployments using Function Deployment Slots
- Functions with Managed Identity accessing Blob, SQL, Service Bus
- Performance tuning: host.json configurations (maxConcurrentCalls, batchSize, prefetchCount)

### Scenario-Based Questions
1. **Scenario:** Your Function App processes messages from Service Bus but starts consuming too many messages when load spikes, causing downstream DB bottlenecks. How do you tune `host.json` to throttle processing?
2. **Scenario:** You're deploying Azure Functions to AKS using KEDA. A Service Bus queue drives scale-out. Walk through the KEDA ScaledObject configuration and how it interacts with your Function App.

# 🎯 Cross-Service Integration Scenarios (Mastery Level)

These tie together multiple Azure services — perfect for senior-level interviews and real-world architecture:

1. **Full Microservice Pipeline:** Angular SPA on App Service → .NET API on AKS → Azure Service Bus (MassTransit + Dapr) → Azure Functions consumer → Blob Storage output → Event Grid notification → downstream Function
2. **Zero-Trust Deployment Pipeline:** GitHub Actions (OIDC Workload Identity) → Builds & pushes to ACR (signed image) → Deploys to private AKS cluster (Workload Identity pods) → Pods read secrets from Key Vault via CSI Driver → APIs behind Application Gateway WAF
3. **Multi-Region Resilience:** Azure Front Door → App Service (primary region) + App Service (secondary region) → AKS with Fleet Manager → Geo-replicated ACR → Geo-redundant Blob Storage (GRS)
4. **Event-Driven Autoscaling:** Blob upload → Event Grid → Service Bus queue → KEDA scales .NET consumer pods in AKS → Consumer processes and writes results to SQL via Managed Identity

---

> 💡 **Pro Tip for You (8 YOE):** Since you already have strong .NET, microservices, RabbitMQ/MassTransit, and Kubernetes experience, focus heavily on **Phases 2 & 3** and the **cross-service scenarios**. The fundamentals will be quick review — the real value for you is in the architectural decision-making and scenario-based questions that test *why* over *what*.
