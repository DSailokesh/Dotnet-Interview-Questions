| 2 | A method receives a `string` that could be `null`. How do you safely parse it into an `int`, and what modern C# features (nullable reference types) would you use to prevent this at compile time? |
| 3 | You have a `Customer` class and a `VIPCustomer` class. How do you decide between inheritance vs. composition? Write a scenario where composition is the better choice. |
| 4 | You need to store a collection of unique employee IDs that frequently need membership checks. Which collection type do you choose and why? |

## 🏆 Pro Tips for Your Learning Path

> **As an 8-year veteran**, focus heavily on **Modules 4–7** (Architecture, Security, Performance, Testing) — these will separate you from the crowd.

- 📌 **Pair each scenario** with a real GitHub repo implementation
- 📌 **Build a capstone project** — an Order Management System using all modules
- 📌 **Benchmark everything** — use BenchmarkDotNet + dotnet-trace for profiling
- 📌 **Write Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** as you learn each pattern
