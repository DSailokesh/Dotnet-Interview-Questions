## 🎯 Pro Tips for Your AKS Journey

> **Given your MassTransit/RabbitMQ background**, focus heavily on **KEDA with RabbitMQ scaler** — this is a killer scenario in interviews and real projects.

> **Given your .NET background**, practice **Workload Identity** for accessing Azure SQL, Service Bus, and Blob Storage — avoid Kubernetes Secrets for credentials entirely.

> **Given your microservices background**, prioritize **NetworkPolicy + Service Mesh** — understanding how traffic flows and how to secure it is critical for AKS at scale.

> **Given your Azure background**, master **Azure Monitor + Container Insights + Log Analytics** integration — this is what separates AKS beginners from production engineers.
